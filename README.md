# Blockchain-Ethereum-Smart-Contracts
This repository contains the implementation of two Ethereum smart contracts: BBSEBank and BBSEToken, developed as part of the CNS 4206 Blockchain Technology & Applications course. The BBSEBank contract enables users to deposit Ether and earn interest in BBSE tokens, while the BBSEToken implements the ERC20 standard using OpenZeppelin contracts. The project includes comprehensive test suites for both contracts and supports deployment to local Ganache network and Sepolia testnet. The development environment is set up using Truffle Suite, with MetaMask integration for transaction signing. Key features include configurable yearly return rates, minimum deposit requirements, interest calculation logic, and secure token minting functionality. The codebase demonstrates practical implementation of smart contract development, testing, and deployment workflows on the Ethereum blockchain.
